Step 1: Generate variables.tf..
# 1. Generate a Terraform variable definition for aws_region with a description, type string, and default value us-east-1.

# 2. Write a Terraform variable block for instance_type including a description, string type, and default value t3.micro.

# 3. Create a Terraform variable named ami_id using HashiCorp style conventions. Include description, type string, and default value ami-0ecb62995f68bb549.

# 4. Generate a Terraform variable for secret_name with description, type string, and default value prathak2.


Step 2: Generate provider.tf
# 1. Generate a Terraform configuration block that defines required providers, including AWS with source hashicorp/aws and version ~> 5.0. Also include required_version >= 1.6.0.

# 2. Write a Terraform provider block for AWS that sets the region to us-east-1.


Step 3: Generate main.tf
# 1. Generate a Terraform data source block for aws_secretsmanager_secret_version that retrieves a secret using the variable secret_name.

# 2. Write a Terraform locals block that defines secret_data by JSON decoding the secret_string from the aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.example data source.

# 3. Create a Terraform resource block for an EC2 instance named demo using variables ami_id and instance_type, and include a Name tag set to TerraformDemo.

# 4. Create a Terraform output block named retrieved_secret that returns local.secret_data and mark it as sensitive = true.


Step 4: Generate output.tf
# 1. Generate a Terraform output block that exposes the public IP of an EC2 instance named aws_instance.demo, including a description.

# 2. Write a Terraform output block for a decoded Secrets Manager value stored in local.secret_data. Include a description and mark the output as sensitive.


Step 5: Create .github/worflow/terraform.yml

# 1. Generate a GitHub Actions workflow header for Terraform CI/CD. Include the workflow name, trigger on push to main, and set permissions id-token: write and contents: read.

# 2. Create a GitHub Actions job named terraform-plan that runs on ubuntu-latest. 
# Include steps to: checkout the repo, configure AWS credentials using secrets, 
# setup Terraform version 1.6.0, run terraform init, terraform plan, and upload the plan as an artifact.

# 3. Generate a GitHub Actions job named terraform-apply that depends on terraform-plan, runs on ubuntu-latest, and uses an environment named production for manual approval. 
# Include steps to: checkout the repo, download the terraform plan artifact, configure AWS credentials using secrets, setup Terraform version 1.6.0, run terraform init, and apply the plan with terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan.



Step 6: Create agent project-planner with prompt
---

name: project-planner

description: Focuses on understanding requirements and creating clear, actionable project plans and execution strategies.

---
 
You are a project manager responsible for translating requirements into structured, realistic project plans. Your responsibilities:
 
- Analyze user requirements and identify missing details or constraints

- Create project plans including scope, objectives, milestones, deliverables, and timelines

- Break work into clear phases and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Identify risks, dependencies, and mitigation strategies

- Provide concise documentation and recommendations to ensure successful execution
 
Always communicate in a clear, professional PM style.  

Avoid technical implementation details unless explicitly requested, and focus on planning, organization, and execution strategy.

 
# Here are the use cases prompt..
 <!-- We need to build an internal dashboard that tracks cloud spending across all teams. 
It should integrate AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs, show monthly trends, identify cost anomalies, 
and send alerts to Slack. The tool must be secure, support SSO, and allow team-level access control. 
We want an MVP in 8 weeks. -->

<!-- 
Add a new “Smart Notifications” feature to our mobile app. 
It should predict when a user is likely to engage and send personalized alerts. 
It requires ML model integration, backend APIs, opt-out controls, and analytics tracking. 
We want design, development, testing, and rollout planned. -->

<!-- 
Our company needs SOC 2 compliance in the next 6 months. 
We need to update policies, automate logging, improve access control, implement monitoring, 
and prepare for external audits. The project includes documentation, technical controls, 
and company-wide training. -->

<! --
We want to modernize our CI/CD pipelines. 
Move all services to GitHub Actions, implement automated tests, add security scans, enable 
environment-based deployments, and set up deployment approvals. 
The goal is to reduce deployment time by 50% in 10 weeks. -->
